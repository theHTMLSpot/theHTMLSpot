# 👋 Hey there, I'm Ethan

🚀 I'm a 13-year-old developer with a passion for building the future — one line of code at a time.  
I specialize in **web apps, game dev, AI, computer vision, and 3D rendering**. Whether it's a fast backend, a beautiful frontend, or a custom AI model, I'm probably working on it before school starts at 4:30AM.
